  description: "In this project you can experience my different AI behaviours! From
    the spawnpoint, go up and meet the most precice archer of the empire, patrolling
    the area until you get too close!\nAlso, take note of the scout that is roaming
    around! She will run away from you, till a nearby reinforcement point and call
    for help! You can cancel her, if you are quick enough!\nAlso, do not get too
    close to the building up north, as it will also trigger small waves of sword
    enemys to spawn! \nHead south-east from your spawn point to find the local population
    of friendly wisps and one overprotective one - if you steal its crystal he will
    go mad and attack you!\nThere is also one friendly wisp following you around.
    Dont be mean to him!"
