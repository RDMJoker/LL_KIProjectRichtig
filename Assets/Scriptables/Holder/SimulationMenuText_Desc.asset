  description: 'In this small scene you can experience my shader and VFX!

    Go
    towards your left and down, until you reach the slowest archer of the empire
    shooting at a target dummy, to see the dissolving arrows!

    Check the local
    merchants for magical crystals! But beware! Go behind the stalls and get attacked
    by a guard, showcasing the unique hit effect!

    Further up the plaza, meet
    Kermit the Wisp, protecting his crystal. Steal it and he will become angry!'
